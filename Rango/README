Rango is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for R.
Currently, Rango only supports Postgres database, patches for other database 
systems are welcome.
We do have plans on working on other database systems in the future.

Rango allows you to use R objects to interact with the database in contrast to 
writing SQL queries and have them executed. Rango currently supports only SELECT
and INSERT statements. Other query types will be developed later on, but we 
think the package in its current state is already quite useful.

The main functions are:
* generateClasses - which generates R object definitions based upon the database 
 structure
* retrieve - Performs a SELECT query based upon the current contents of an
 instance of an object
* store - Performs an INSERT query based upon the current contents of an
 instance of an object
